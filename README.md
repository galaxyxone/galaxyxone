## 👋 Hi, I’m @galaxyxone

We have a few projects brewing up here at GalaxyX.io and were happy to show you more- Right now mainly we are focusing on verifying/hashing data using IPFS. 

  We started with a webapp built on React and Node.js using Auth0 for our login. Our Alpha is hosted at https://www.galerielestudio.com
  
 you can find that project at github.com/galaxyxone/glsx_live1.2


- 👀 I’m interested in decentralized systems, peer-to-peer networks, security basics, and crypto/blockchain networks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, JS, Solidity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IPFS javascript projects  
- 📫 You can reach me at llentz@galaxyx.io or view my teams website at http://www.galaxyx.io
